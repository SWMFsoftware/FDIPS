# Install FDIPS #
#################

# Many machines used by UofM are already recognized by the 
# share/Scripts/Config.pl script which is called by the top 
# level Config.pl script.
# For these platform/compiler combinations installation is very simple:

Config.pl -install

# On other platforms the Fortan compiler and MPI libraries should be explicitly
# given. See the share/build and share/include directories for options.
# Example:

Config.pl -install -compiler=ifort -mpi=openmpi

#################
# Running tests #
#################

# You can try running the standard test suite by typing

make test

# Successful passing of the test is indicated by empty *.diff files.

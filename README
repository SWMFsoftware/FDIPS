This document outlines how to install the FDIPS code

#################
# Opening FDIPS #
#################

# Open FDIPS tar ball
cd {where_you_want_to_have_the_fdips_code}
tar -xzf {path_to_file}/FDIPS_v{version_number}.tgz

#################
# Install FDIPS #
#################

# Many machines used by UofM are already recognized by the 
# share/Scripts/Config.pl script which is called by the top 
# level Config.pl script.
# For these platform/compiler combinations installation is very simple:

Config.pl -install

# On other platforms the Fortan compiler should be explicitly given. Type

Config.pl -compiler

# for a list of options. Note that "f95" refers to the NAG Fortran compiler,
# and "gfortran" to the GNU Fortran compiler.
# Select the appropriate compiler and install the code, for example:

Config.pl -install -compiler=ifort

# If you do not have an MPI library installed, use the -nompi flag
# for installation, for example

Config.pl -install -nompi -compiler=gfortran

# Note that only the serial FDIPS1 code can work without MPI. 

####################
# Read the manuals #
####################

# The manual can be found in 

doc/FDIPS.pdf

#################
# Running tests #
#################

# Try running the standard test suite by typing

make test

# For serial test only type

make test_fdips1

# Successful passing of the test is indicated by empty *.diff files.

####################
# Editing FDIPS.in #
####################

# The run directory is created by the test, but it can also be created with
make run

# The FDIPS input parameter file run/FDIPS.in can either be edited with
# a standard text editor (like emacs) or with the parameter editor GUI:
share/Scripts/ParamEditor.pl run/FDIPS.in

# This GUI is based on the PARAM.XML file that can also be read directly.
